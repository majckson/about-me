                My name is Morgan Jackson. I was born in Florida but claim Kansas as my home. Kansas is where I spent most of my childhood. I traveled out to North Carolina in 2012 to start my career in the airline industry where I found a job that I absolutely love! That job brought me out to Seattle, WA where I continue to fly but have also found my own little slice of heaven in the PNW.
